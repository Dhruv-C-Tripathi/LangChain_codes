# 🚀 GenAI Experiments with LangChain & Groq

This repository contains my hands-on experiments with **LangChain**, **Groq**, and **HuggingFace**, exploring modern LLM pipelines, prompt templating, chaining, and structured outputs.

The goal of this project is to understand how to build production-ready AI workflows using the latest Runnable-style LangChain architecture.
